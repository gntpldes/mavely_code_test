# The Rundown

I have not built anything with a backend in well over a year... probably closer to two now that I give it some thought. This coding test is a healthy reminder of why I need to get back into practice with mobile, and backend for that matter. In the first three hours I've been working on this, I've ran through a pot of my 1/4 caff blend coffee and am amping it up to half strength. 
I'm certain with a little coaching, that I'd be execelent at setting up the React Backend. 

For the sake of not stressing myself out, or caffinating myself to the point of requring a 6 mile run to get a halfway decent night's sleep going into a hectic weekend, I'm creating two versions of this coding test. 

# Version 1 COMPLETED 
Will have everything listed internally. And was completed after about 4 hours of work 

# Version 2 and Version 3
Will be completed by Sunday the 17th. 
Version 2 will link the data to an internal JSON file


# Version 3
I will attempt to list everything to Mavely's External Rest API

What bugs me is that I know that the reason I'm having trouble with the backend is largely due to my lack of recent experience with it. React Native is easy enough now that I'm used to writing Design Code with it.
