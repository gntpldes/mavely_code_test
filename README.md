# The Rundown

I have not built anything with a backend in well over a year... This coding test is a healthy reminder of why I need to get back into practice. In the first three hours I've been working on this, I've ran through a pot of my 1/4 caff blend coffee and am amping it up to half strength. 
I'm certain with a little coaching, that I'd be execelent at setting up the React Backend. 

For the sake of not stressing myself out, or caffinating myself to the point of requring a 6 mile run to get a halfway decent night's sleep going into a hectic weekend, I'm creating two versions of this coding test. 

# Version 1 
Will have everything listed internally. 

# Version 2
I will attempt to list everything to Mavely's External Rest API
