# Version 3 was fun, I've not uploaded it because I couldn't get the external databases linked. 

I guess this is techinically version 3, as it's the third one that I attempted. I'm going to be on the phone with MongoDB techinical support tomorrow, as it seems to be a password issue that I'm encountering. 
What I attempted to do with this was create an external JSON file that I would've ran through a For Loop to display the product data, the moment I attempted that I got 80+ errors... 
I'm going to continue working on this, as I need to have the Mongo issue solved for my own apps. 
But as of now, it's nearly 8pm on Sunday, this was a lot of fun for a coding challenge. I'm hoping to get the chance to work with Mavely, as it's the most interesting company that I've interviewed with in the last year.
